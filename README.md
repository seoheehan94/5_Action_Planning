# The effect of action planning on attention

This study examines how planning a simple action influences attention in visual search. Using behavioural experiments and statistical analysis, I show that merely preparing an action—without physically executing it—biases attention toward task-irrelevant object features. These findings suggest that action planning alone can shape visual processing, highlighting the interaction between motor preparation and attentional allocation.
